**Switcher API** is a *Feature Flag* API focused on decreasing the friction caused by changes providing a simple and flexible interface.

Main features:
- Control & track more using little effort by sharing switchers among application components.
- Cross environment. Generate zero impact when manipulating your project features.
- Customizable environment strategies. Setup switchers using variables per environment.
- Delegate Switcher analysis to external services with secured Switcher Relay.
- Create manageable teams to collaborate.
- Keep track of every modification and features usage.
- Detailed metrics.
- SDKs support zero-latency mode for performance improvement.
- Exclusive Slack App to control and test changes.

## Under the hood
* * *

Orchestrate changes based on business strategies without worrying about what should be done under the hood. Switcher API has the responsibility to evaluate all conditions provided and redirect the flow based on the configuration made during the implementation of the new feature.

### Multi-environment & Strategies
* * *

Sometimes covering 100% of tests does not guarantee a successful deployment, nor prevents underestimated reception of a new idea. Switcher API provides the right control to optimize deployment processes, conditioning what and when a new feature can be used. In addition, the multi-environment settings enable a smoother transition, generating less friction and eliminating uncovered scenarios that would cause applications to crash.

## Under the hood
Orchestrate changes based on business strategies without worrying about what should be done under the hood. Switcher API has the responsibility to evaluate all conditions provided and redirect the flow based on the configuration made during the implementation of the new feature.

### Multi-environment & Strategies
Sometimes covering 100% of tests does not guarantee a successful deployment, nor prevents underestimated reception of a new idea. Switcher API provides the right control to optimize deployment processes, conditioning what and when a new feature can be used. In addition, the multi-environment settings enable a smoother transition, generating less friction and eliminating uncovered scenarios that would cause applications to crash.

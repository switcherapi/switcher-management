## About  
**Switcher API** is a *Feature Flag* API focused on decreasing the friction caused by changes providing a simple and flexible interface.

Main features:
- More control over new features.
- Multi-environment. Work and perform tests without impacting production environments.
- Customizable environment strategies. Setup switchers using variables per environment.
- Create manageable teams to collaborate.
- Keep track of every change.
- Detailed and visual metrics.
- API endpoints exposed in REST and GraphQL.
- Offline mode also enables your applications to work with no latency.

## Under the hood
Orchestrate changes based on business strategies without worrying about what should be done under the hood. Switcher API has the responsibility to evaluate all conditions provided and redirect the flow based on the configuration made during the implementation of the new feature.

### Multi-environment & Strategies
Sometimes covering 100% of tests does not guarantee a successful deployment, nor prevents underestimated reception of a new idea. Switcher API provides the right control to optimize deployment processes, conditioning what and when a new feature can be used. In addition, the multi-environment settings enable a smoother transition, generating less friction and eliminating uncovered scenarios that would cause applications to crash.

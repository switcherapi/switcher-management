#### Change Request
* * *

Allow your team to have access to all features controlled by Switcher API without being overwhelmed with access-hell to different platforms.</br>
The idea of providing such a feature is to keep everyone looking in the same direction and centralize communication channels within the same platform.

Change Request is available to everyone that has access to the Workspace and provides a fast and powerful input to organizations to evaluate and perform changes.

##### **Creating a Ticket**

Opening a ticket is simple and requires you to select environments, features, and groups of features that you want to change.

##### **Ticket Review**

After selecting the components of your ticket, you can review and add an observation that is useful to describe why this change is important.</br>
The app is fully capable to identify an already opened ticket and republish it to the approval channel. Validations are also executed behind the scenes to make sure that the ticket is consistent and coherent.

##### **Ticket evaluation**

When submitted, the ticket is automatically published for approval.</br>
Once the ticket is approved or denied, the message is updated with the action taken, and the event is sent to Switcher API.

  **Smart Search**

  This little component found on the right side of your Domain's menu can easily assist you to find the configuration element you are looking for.

  Simple to use but let me demonstrate how powerful it can be.

  1. If you are looking for Switchers used by a specific component, you can type the component name and it will bring all switchers configured to that component.

  2. You can also filter elements by its prefix: 's:' for Switcher, 'g:' for Groups and 'c:' for Components

  3. The search algorithm is also prepared for looking at elements description, thus it can be a good practice to add tags or keywords on all groups and switchers that you create.

  **Intelligent filtering**

  Tracking a specific input from the Metrics dashboard can be troublesome if your domain deal with a large volume of inputed data.
  With that in mind, this single input filter can find the exact match you are looking for.
  
  That means that the same input can find the information you are looking at in all columns of both Data Metrics and Change Log tables.

  **Mobile viewport**

  Switcher Management is fully responsive to work with large and small viewports. Considering these variations, we built the best and simple layout for both scenarios.

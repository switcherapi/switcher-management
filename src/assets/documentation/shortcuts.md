  **Smart Search**

  This simple input text found on the right side of your Domain's menu can easily assist you to find the configuration element you are looking for.

  Here are some examples of how it works.

  1. If you are looking for Switchers used by a specific component, you can just type the component's name that it will bring all switchers linked to it.

  2. You can also filter elements by its prefix: 's:' for Switcher, 'g:' for Groups and 'c:' for Components

  3. The search algorithm is also prepared for looking at elements description, thus it can be a good practice to add tags or keywords on all groups and switchers that you create.

  **Intelligent filtering**

  Tracking a specific input from Metrics or Change Log dashboards can be troublesome if your domain deal with a large volume of stored data.
  With that in mind, this single input filter can extract the exact match for what you are looking for.
  
  That means that the same input can find the information you are looking at in all columns of both Data Metrics and Change Log tables.

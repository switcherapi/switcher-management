#### Overview
Collaborate creating teams to work upon the same domain. With Teams, you can invite people to have access to settings of your domain, plus managing their access to every aspect of it.

Teams are composed of Members and Roles. In addition to roles that will group all permissions granted to that team, it is also possible to activate and deactivate a team at any time.

### Features
- Flexible and robust functions that will keep your code clean and maintainable.
- Able to work offline using a snapshot file downloaded from your remote Switcher-API Domain.
- Silent mode is a hybrid configuration that automatically enables a contingent sub-process in case of any connectivity issue.
- Built-in mock implementation for clear and easy implementation of automated testing.
- Easy to setup. Switcher Context is responsible to manage all the complexity between your application and API.

### Usage

##### - Install  
- Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.switcherapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>switcher-client</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.8</version>
</dependency>
```

</br>

##### - Context properties
The context map properties stores all information regarding connectivity and strategy settings. These constants can be accessed using *SwitcherContextParam*.

- URL: Endpoint of your Swither-API - e.g. https://switcher-load-balance.herokuapp.com.
- APIKEY: Switcher-API key generated after creating a domain.
- DOMAIN: Domain name.
- COMPONENT: Application name.
- ENVIRONMENT: Environment name. Production environment is named as 'default'.
- SILENT_MODE: (boolean) Activate contingency in case of some problem with connectivity with the API.
- RETRY_AFTER: Time given to the module to re-establish connectivity with the API - e.g. 5s (s: seconds - m: minutes - h: hours)
- SNAPSHOT_LOCATION: Set the folder location where snapshot files will be saved.
- SNAPSHOT_AUTO_LOAD: (boolean) Set the module to automatically download the snapshot configuration.

All set, you can now build the context.

```java
SwitcherFactory.buildContext(properties, false);
```

</br>

##### - Executing
There are a few different ways to call the API using the java library.
</br>Here are some examples:

1. **No parameters**

  Invoking the API can be done by obtaining the switcher object and calling *isItOn*. It can also be forced to call another key any time you want.

  ```java
  Switcher switcher = SwitcherFactory.getSwitcher("FEATURE01");
  switcher.isItOn();
  //or
  switcher.isItOn("FEATURE01");
  ```

2. **Strategy validation - preparing input**

  Loading values into the switcher can be done by using *prepareEntry*, in case you want to include input from a different place of your code. Otherwise, it is also possible to include everything in the same call.

  ```java
  List<Entry> entries = new ArrayList<>();
  entries.add(new Entry(Entry.DATE, "2019-12-10"));
  entries.add(new Entry(Entry.DATE, "2020-12-10"));
  
  switcher.prepareEntry(entries);
  switcher.isItOn();
  //or
  switcher.isItOn(entries);
  ```

  Strategy validators can be specified as:
  - Entry.DATE: Date validation
  - Entry.TIME: Time validation
  - Entry.VALUE: Plain text validation
  - Entry.NUMERIC: Numeric validation
  - Entry.NETWORK: IP/range validation
  - Entry.REGEX: Regular expression validation


3. **Strategy validation - chained call**

  Create chained calls using 'getSwitcher' then 'prepareEntry' then 'isItOn' functions.

  ```java
  Switcher switcher = SwitcherFactory.getSwitcher("FEATURE01")
        .prepareEntry(new Entry(Entry.VALUE, "My value"))
        .prepareEntry(new Entry(Entry.NETWORK, "10.0.0.1"))
        .isItOn();
  ```

4. **Strategy validation - all-in-one execution**

  All-in-one method is fast and include everything you need to execute a complex call to the API. Stack inputs changing the last parameter to *true* in case you need to add more values to the strategy validator.

  ```java
  switcher.isItOn("FEATURE01", new Entry(Entry.NETWORK, "10.0.0.3"), false);
  ```

5. **Accessing the response history**

  Switchers when created store the last execution result from a given switcher key. This can be useful for troubleshooting or internal logging.
  
  ```java
  switcher.getHistoryExecution();
  ```

##### - Real-time snapshot updater
Let the Switcher Client manage your application local snapshot file.

In order to minimize roundtrips and unnecessary file parsing, try to use one of these features to improve the overall performance when accessing snapshots locally.

1. This feature will update the in-memory Snapshot every time a modification on the file occurs.
```java
SwitcherFactory.watchSnapshot();
SwitcherFactory.stopWatchingSnapshot();
```

2. You can tell the Switcher Client to check if the snapshot file is updated. This will ensure that your application is running the most recent version of your cloud configuration.
```java
SwitcherFactory.validateSnapshot();
```

##### - Offline settings
You can also force the Switcher library to work offline. In this case, the snapshot location must be set up and the context re-built using the offline flag.

```java
properties.put(SwitcherContextParam.SNAPSHOT_LOCATION, "/src/resources");
SwitcherFactory.buildContext(properties, true);
```

</br>

##### - Built-in mock feature
Write automated tests using this built-in mock mechanism to guide your test scenario according to what you want to test.
</br>*SwitcherExecutor* implementation has 2 methods that can make mock tests easier. Use assume to force a value to a switcher and forget to reset its original state.

```java
Switcher switcher = SwitcherFactory.getSwitcher("FEATURE01");

SwitcherExecutor.assume("FEATURE01", false);
switcher.isItOn(); // 'false'

SwitcherExecutor.forget("FEATURE01");
switcher.isItOn(); // Now, it's going to return the result retrieved from the API or the Snaopshot file
```

#### Overview
Create conditions that would enable the use of a new feature. These rules are not necessarily part of the implementation, however, they might be fundamental to assure that new changes are working properly not on a small proportion but controllable scope.
</br>Running multiple versions of your project can bring safeness by providing a soft-launch carrying less impact to your production environment.

The advantages of using strategies are:
- Assure that it is working as intended/tested
- Get early feedbacks
- Prepare for a bigger change
- Easy to monitor

*Fast response to negative feedbacks without impacting the final release.*

#### Usage
For each switcher it is possible to add at least 4 different types of strategy.
</br>For each strategy you can choose one of the available operations.

1. **Value validation**

  This plain text validator can be used to compare one or more string data you want.
  </br>The available operations for this validator are: Exist, Not exist, Equal, Not equal

2. **Time and Date validation**

  Both validators are useful to test specific or range of date/time.
  </br>The available operations for this validator are: between, Lower, Greater

3. **Network validation**

  Add network conditions if you want to restrict by a unique IP address or a range of IPs using CIDR notation.
  </br>The available operations for this validator are: Exist, Not exist

#### Cloning strategies
Strategies are defined per environment, adding more flexibility for you to specify conditions that are not shared or common among environments.
</br>To simplify, it is possible to clone a created strategy instead of starting from scratch.

#### Monitoring
Keep control of what is being sent as input to strategies. Under Metrics - Data tab view, besides the result of each call executed you can see what it was sent for each strategy.
